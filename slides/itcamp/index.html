					<aside class="notes">
						Incident response methodologies typically emphasize preparationâ€”not only establishing an incident response
						capability so that the organization is ready to respond to incidents, but also preventing incidents by
						ensuring that systems, networks, and applications are sufficiently secure. Although the incident
						response team is not typically responsible for incident prevention, it is fundamental to the success of
						incident response programs.

					<h3>Evidence Gathering and Handling</h3>
					<p>It is generally desirable to acquire evidence from a system of interest as soon as one suspects that an
						incident may have occurred.</p>
				</section>
				<section data-auto-animate>
					<h3>Evidence Gathering and Handling</h3>
					<p>From an evidentiary standpoint, it is much better to get a snapshot of the system as-is rather than doing
						so after incident handlers, system administrators, and others have inadvertently altered the state of the
						machine during the investigation.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Identifying the Attacking Hosts</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Validating the Attacking Hostâ€™s IP Address</li>
						<li>Researching the Attacking Host through Search Engines</li>
						<li>Using Incident Databases</li>
						<li>Monitoring Possible Attacker Communication Channels</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section data-auto-animate>
					<h3>Eradication and Recovery</h3>
					<p>After an incident has been contained, eradication may be necessary to eliminate components of the incident.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section data-auto-animate>
					<h3>Eradication and Recovery</h3>
					<p>During eradication, it is important to identify all affected hosts within the organization so that they can
						be remediated.</p>
				</section>
				<section data-auto-animate>
					<h3>Eradication and Recovery</h3>
					<p>In recovery, administrators restore systems to normal operation, confirm that the systems are functioning
						normally, and (if applicable) remediate vulnerabilities to prevent similar incidents.</p>

						<li>Exactly what happened, and at what times?</li>
						<li>How well did staff and management perform?</li>
						<!--How well did staff and management perform in dealing with the incident? Were the documented procedures followed? Were they adequate?-->

					<h3>Evidence Retention</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Prosecution</li>
						<li>Data Retention</li>
						<li>Cost</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						<ul>
							<li>Prosecution. If it is possible that the attacker will be prosecuted, evidence may need to be retained
								until all legal actions have been completed.</li>
							<li>Data Retention. Most organizations have data retention policies that state how long certain types of
								data may be kept.</li>
							<li>Cost. If an organization stores many such components for years, the cost can be substantial</li>
